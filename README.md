🚀 Employee Promotion Prediction
⭐ Overview
This project predicts employee promotions using machine learning. It aims to assist HR departments in making data-driven and fair promotion decisions.

📌 Features
✅ Predict promotions based on employee attributes.
✅ Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categories.
✅ Multiple ML models tested for best performance.
✅ Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
✅ Optional API Deployment for real-world integration.

🧪 Testing Phase
The testing phase of the Employee Promotion Prediction project involves evaluating the trained models with real employee data to ensure predictions are accurate and fair.

Testing Steps
Test Data Preparation
The test data consists of employee attributes that were not part of the training set. The model uses the following features for prediction:

No. of trainings (no_of_trainings)
Age (age)
Previous year rating (previous_year_rating)
Length of service (length_of_service)
Awards won (awards_won)
Average training score (avg_training_score)
Department (department)
Education (education)
Gender (gender)
Recruitment channel (recruitment_channel)
Region (region)
Test Predictions
The model is tested with different employee data samples to predict whether they will be promoted or not (output 0 or 1). Below are some examples:

Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is assessed using the following metrics:

📌 Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
📌 Precision: The accuracy of positive predictions.
📌 Recall: The model's ability to correctly identify positive samples.
📌 F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.

Testing Results
🏆 Best model achieved X% accuracy, Y precision, Z recall, W F1-score.
🔍 Top influencing factors: previous_year_rating, avg_training_score, length_of_service.

Testing Conclusion
The model demonstrates strong predictive power in determining employee promotions. Further improvements, such as expanding the dataset and refining feature selection, can enhance model fairness and accuracy.
