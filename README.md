# 🚀 Employee Promotion Prediction

## ⭐️ Overview
This project predicts employee promotions using machine learning. It aims to assist HR departments in making data-driven and fair promotion decisions.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 Predict promotions based on employee attributes.
- 🛠 Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categories.
- 🤖 Multiple ML models tested for best performance.
- 📊 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 🌐 Optional API Deployment for real-world integration.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/abigiyaelias180/machine-learning.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for analysis or execute app.py to deploy the API.

## 🚀 Usage
- Train Model: Run the notebook to preprocess data and train models.
- Evaluate Model: Compare different algorithms and metrics.
- Deploy API (Optional):
- 
python app.py

Live Deployment: Access the deployed API here 👉 https://machine-learning-6-tkjg.onrender.com/docs

## 📈 Results
- 🏆 Best model: X% accuracy, Y precision, Z recall, W F1-score.
- 🔑 Top influencing factors: previous_year_rating, avg_training_score, length_of_service.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- ⚖️ Improve fairness in predictions.
- 📂 Expand dataset for better generalization.
- 📊 Create a dashboard for visualization.
